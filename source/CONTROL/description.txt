The qBittorrent project aims to provide a Free Software alternative to Âµtorrent. Additionally, qBittorrent runs and provides the same features on all major platforms (Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, OS/2, FreeBSD).

qBittorrent is based on Qt5 toolkit and libtorrent-rasterbar.

Default username and password (same as qBittorrent uses by default):
